# Sample_superstore
This Dataset came from Kaggle:

This is a sample superstore dataset, a kind of a simulation where we can perform extensive data analysis to deliver insights on how the company can increase its profits while minimizing the losses. Itâ€™s a retail dataset of a USA superstore of 4 years. It contains 9,995 rows and 21 columns.

I used Tableau platform for analyzing results. I used Sales, Profit, calculated Profit Ratio, quantity sold, segment, sub-category, etc. data to design by KPI dashboard.
